# Project1_486: *Research Project for GES 687*

## Topic
**The topic of my research is to estimate whether R1-zoning restrictions (commonly referred to as "single family zoning restrictions") influences resedential segregation by decreasing housing supply and affordability for those who are lower-income.**

### What is the data & Where is the data coming from? 
To do my project, I will take data on zoning policy that details where R1-zoning restrictions are present across Maryland's 23 Counties, and then using data obtained from the Maryland Census to compare the various demographics and community outcomes of neighborhoods that operate within or outside of R1-zoning restrictions.
