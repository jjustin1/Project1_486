# Project1_486: *Research Project for GES 687*

## Topic
The topic of my research is to estimate whether Single-Family Zoning Restrictions (commonly referred to as "R1 zoning restrictions") influences resedential segregation by decreasing housing supply and affordability for those who are lower-income.

## What is the data & Where is the data coming from? 
To do my project, I will take data on zoning policy that details where R1-zoning restrictions are present across the Baltimore region and then compare it to demographic data obtained from the Maryland Census to compare the various characteristics of neighborhoods that operate within or outside of single family zoning restrictions. Zoning data was obtained from Real Property Datasets available at from the Maryland Department of Planning, while data on community characterstics was obtained from the 2018 ACS survey. 

## Any necessary transformations or subsets? 
The only transformations necessary will be when creating maps that detail Maryland's zoning policy for different counties. 

## What is the analysis that will be performed? 
My overall project will compare the income dissimilarity indexes of the different census tracts that operate under or outside of single-family zoning restrictions, effectively estimating the degree of income segregation present within the different counties. Once these indexes are obtained, I will construct a linear probability model  to measure the likelihood that a census tract utilizes single-family zoning restrictions (given different levels of resedential segregation) by performing binary logit regression.

However, because this is only my first project I chose to just compare the total amount of single family zoning present in the county to the total number of people making less than $30,000/yr in each census tract (essentially calculating the number of poor people in a given area).

## What outputs will be created? 
The outputs for my overall project would be both the dissimilarity index estimating how segregated census tracts are from eachother, as well as the values estimating the overall probability that an income segregated community operates within or outside of Single-Family zoning restrictions. 

For this first project, my outputs will be the values I receive for the total population making less than $30,000/yr, as well as the values showing where single family zoning restrictions are present.
