# Project1_486: *Research Project for GES 687*

## Topic
The topic of my research is to estimate whether R1-zoning restrictions (commonly referred to as "single family zoning restrictions") influences resedential segregation by decreasing housing supply and affordability for those who are lower-income.

### What is the data & Where is the data coming from? 
To do my project, I will take data on zoning policy that details where R1-zoning restrictions are present across Maryland's 23 Counties, and then using data obtained from the Maryland Census to compare the various demographics and community outcomes of neighborhoods that operate within or outside of R1-zoning restrictions. 

#### Any necessary transformations or subsets? 
The only transformations necessary will be when creating maps that detail Maryland's zoning policy for different counties. 

##### What is the analysis that will be performed? 
After creating zoning maps using QGIS software, data on demographics and census data will be compared with the data within the zoning maps to estimate the relationship existing between R1-zoning restrictions and community outcomes such as median income, educational attainment, property value, and housing affordability. To meausre these relationships, I will most likely use linear or quantile regression to measure the impact of R1 zoning on community groups at different levels of income, wealth, or community access (using R or STATA software). 

###### What outputs will be created? 
Once zoning data has been created, the only outputs being created would be a dummy variable that identifies whether a resident lives in a district with R1-zoning restrictions (R1=1 or R1=0), and another potentially detailing the level of housing affordability present in various Maryland Counties (either using a measure like the housing affordabilty index or creating a new variable that captures the proportion of properties in a district that could be reasonably rented by low-income renters/buyers)
