# Project1_486: *Research Project for GES 687*

## Topic
The topic of my research is to estimate whether Single-Family Zoning Restrictions (commonly referred to as "R1 zoning restrictions") influences resedential segregation by decreasing housing supply and affordability for those who are lower-income.

## What is the data & Where is the data coming from? 
To do my project, I will take data on zoning policy that details where R1-zoning restrictions are present across the Baltimore region and then compare it to demographic data obtained from the Maryland Census to compare the various characteristics of neighborhoods that operate within or outside of single family zoning restrictions. 

## Any necessary transformations or subsets? 
The only transformations necessary will be when creating maps that detail Maryland's zoning policy for different counties. 

## What is the analysis that will be performed? 
My overall project will compare the income dissimilarity indexes of the different census tracts that operate under or outside of single-family zoning restrictions, effectively estimating the degree of income segregation present within the different counties. For this project however, I chose to compare the degree of single family zoning present to the  total number of people making less than $30,000/yr (an estimate for the number of low-income people in the area)

## What outputs will be created? 
The outputs created for this specific project will be the values I receive for the total population making less than $30,000/yr, as well as the values showing where single family zoning restrictions are present. For the overall project, my output will be looking at the dissimilarity indexes present for the various census tracts.
